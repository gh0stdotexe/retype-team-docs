## Installation Guide

We will now guide you through the steps required to get PANIC up and running. We recommend that PANIC is installed on a Linux system and that everything needed in the [Requirements](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#requirements) section is done before the installation procedure is started.

As you will notice below, PANIC supports many alerting channels. It is recommended that at least one of the alerting channels mentioned in the requirements section is set up.

### Requirements

- **Git** command-line tools. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#git-installation) if you want a guide to 5a. Tenderduty v1: Incident Alertingset it up.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: This installation guide uses Docker and Docker Compose to run PANIC, these will need to be installed. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#docker-and-docker-compose-installation) if you want a guide to set it up.

### Optional

- **Node Exporter** will be used to monitor the systems on which the nodes are running. If you want your nodes' systems to be monitored this step is no longer optional. Node Exporter must also be installed on each machine that you want to monitor. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#node-exporter-setup) if you want a guide to set it up.
- **Telegram account and bots**, for Telegram alerts and commands. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#telegram-setup) if you want a guide to set it up.
- **Slack account and app**, for Slack alerts and commands. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#slack-setup) if you want a guide to set it up.
- **Twilio account**, for phone call alerts. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#twilio-setup) if you want a guide to set it up.
- **PagerDuty account**, for notifications and phone call alerts. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#pagerduty-setup) if you want a guide to set it up.
- **OpsGenie account**, for notifications and phone call alerts. [Click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/tree/master#opsgenie-setup) if you want a guide to set it up.

### Installation

**TIP**: If your terminal is telling you that you do not have permissions to run a command try adding `sudo` to your command e.g, `sudo docker --version` this will run your command as root. If you have any issues during the installation procedure check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) section.

### Git Installation

**Note**: Skip this step if Git is already installed.

Firstly we will install and verify your Git installation.

```shell
# Install Git
sudo apt install git

# Verify that git is now installed
git --version
```

This should give you the current version of git that has been installed.

### Docker and Docker Compose Installation

**Note**: Skip this step if Docker and Docker Compose are already installed.

First, install Docker and Docker Compose by running these commands on your terminal.

```shell
# Install docker and docker-compose
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo apt install docker-compose -y

# Confirm that installation successful
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

These should give you the current versions of the software that have been installed. At the time of writing the current working docker version is `20.10.10` while the docker-compose version is `1.25.0`. If you have a different version that doesn't allow you to run the `docker-compose.yml` file then either upgrade your versions of `docker` and `docker-compose` or change the version inside of the `docker-compose.yml` file which is currently at `3.7`.

### Configuration Setup

```shell
# Clone the panic repository and navigate into it
git clone https://github.com/SimplyVC/panic
cd panic
```

Now that you're inside the PANIC directory, open up the .env file and change the `INSTALLER_USERNAME` and `INSTALLER_PASSWORD` fields to your preferred but secure choice. This is to ensure that when configuring PANIC through the web installer no one else can access it. Moreover, the `UI_ACCESS_IP` field must also be changed to the IP of where PANIC UI is going to be hosted (can be set to `localhost` if running locally). This is to ensure that the API is only accessible from the UI. Helper scripts can be used to get the IP address (`scripts/get_ip_linux.sh` and `scripts/get_ip_mac.sh`) are available but please note that these are not guaranteed to work on all servers/machines.

```shell
# This will access the .env file on your terminal
nano .env
```

Once inside change `UI_ACCESS_IP`, `INSTALLER_USERNAME` and `INSTALLER_PASSWORD` accordingly. Here is an example:

```shell
UI_ACCESS_IP=SERVERIP
INSTALLER_USERNAME=panic_operator
INSTALLER_PASSWORD=wowthisisasecurepassword
```

Update Subnet in `nano.env` and `docker-compose.yml`:

```shell
# replace existing subnet IPs in both files
173.x.x.x (vs old 172.x.x.x)
```

Then to exit hit the following keys:

1. To exit your .env file: CTRL + X
2. To select yes to save your modified file: Y
3. To confirm the file name and exit: ENTER

**Running PANIC**

Once you have everything setup, you can start PANIC by running the below command:

```shell
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

**NOTE** If the build fails run these commands to clean your `docker` images and try again. Please be aware that these commands will also stop other `docker` images that you might have running on your system.

```shell
sudo docker-compose kill
sudo docker system prune -a --volumes
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

Now you will have to configure PANIC to monitor your nodes and systems as well as give it the channels to alert you through. To do this you will have to navigate to the running web installer. This can be found at `https://{UI_ACCESS_IP}:8000`, or at [`https://localhost:8000`](https://localhost:8000) if you're running it locally. The installer will first ask you to enter the username and password. These are `INSTALLER_USERNAME` and `INSTALLER_PASSWORD` which you have changed previously. Make sure you type **HTTPS** if you're getting an error when accessing the installer on your browser.

After you set up PANIC to your liking, the Web-Installer will save these details in the form of configuration files inside the `config` folder. For correct behavior, these configuration files should never be modified. If you would like to edit them at some point, we suggest re-running the web installer again. The web installer will ask you if you want to start a fresh install or load your old configuration.

PANIC will automatically read these configuration files and begin monitoring the data sources. To check that this is the case we suggest running the command `docker-compose logs -f alerter` and `docker-compose logs -f health-checker`. By this, you can see the different components starting up. If you have set up telegram/slack commands we suggest that you enter the command `/status` to check that all PANIC components are running. If you really want to check that PANIC is up and running, we suggest that you check that all the logs inside `panic/alerter/logs` have no errors.

You can visualize node metrics and alerts using PANIC UI, which can be accessed at `https://{UI_ACCESS_IP}:3333`, or at [`https://localhost:3333`](https://localhost:3333) if you're running it locally. For more information regarding PANIC UI, [click here](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/blob/master/ui/README.md).

Congratulations you should have PANIC up and running!

## Notification Channels / Configuration

### Telegram Setup

1. To create a free **Telegram account**, download the [app for Android / iPhone](https://telegram.org/) and sign up using your phone number.
2. To create a **Telegram bot**, add [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) on Telegram, press Start, and follow the below steps:
   1. Send a `/newbot` command and fill in the requested details, including a bot name and username.
   2. Take a note of the API token, which looks something like `111111:AAA-AAA111111-aaaaa11111`.
   3. Access the link `t.me/<username>` to your new bot given by BotFather and press Start.
   4. Access the link `api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates`, replacing `<token>` with the bot's API token. This gives a list of the bot's activity, including messages sent to the bot.
   5. The result section should contain at least one message, due to us pressing the Start button. If not, sending a `/start` command to the bot should do the trick. Take a note of the `"id"` number in the `"chat"` section of this message.
   6. One bot is enough for now. You can repeat these steps to create more bots.

**In the end, you should have:**

1. A Telegram account
2. A Telegram bot *(at least one)*
3. The Telegram bot's API token *(at least one)*
4. The chat ID of your chat with the bot *(at least one)*

### Slack Setup

1. Log in to Slack using an existing account or [sign up](https://slack.com/get-started) for a **Slack account**.
2. If you are not in a workspace, join a workspace from an invite or [create](https://slack.com/create) a workspace.
3. Create a channel within the workspace that will be used to receive notifications and interact with the Slack Bot.
4. To create a **Slack app**, visit the [slack apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and press `Create New App`. The steps below are to be used to set up the app, which include gathering the app-level token, the bot token, and the channel ID:
   1. Click the `From an app manifest` option in the pop-up window.
   2. Select the `workspace` which contains the target channel.
   3. Copy the [YAML app manifest](https://github.com/gh0stdotexe/panic/blob/master/slack_manifest.yaml) provided within the PANIC repository and overwrite the default YAML provided by Slack.
   4. Click `Next` followed by `Create`.
   5. Scroll down to the `App-Level Tokens` section and click `Generate Token and Scopes`.
   6. Enter a `Token Name` (this is just a reference to the token which can be set to anything), add the `connections:write` scope, and click `Generate`.
   7. Take note of the Token generated, this is the App-Level Token.
   8. Go to the 'Install App' setting (left pane) and click `Install to Workspace`, followed by `Allow`.
   9. Go to the 'OAuth & Permissions' feature (left pane) and take note of the `Bot User OAuth Token`.
   10. Add the newly created `PANIC Notifications` app to the target channel by typing `/add` within the channel and selecting `Add apps to this channel`.
   11. Right-click the actual app that was added to the workspace, then `Open app details` and from there `+ add app to channel`.
5. Go to the Slack client, right-click the name of the target slack channel within the list of channels (left pane), and click `Open channel details`, and take note of the Channel ID *(found at the bottom)*.

**In the end, you should have:**

1. Access to a Slack workspace
2. A Slack account, app, and channel
3. The Slack app's Bot User Token and App-Level Token
4. The ID of the target slack channel

### Twilio Setup

- To create a free trial **Twilio account**, head to the [try-twilio page](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and sign up using your details.
- Next, three important pieces of information have to be obtained:
  1. Navigate to the [account dashboard page](https://www.twilio.com/console).
  2. Click the 'Get a Trial Number' button in the dashboard to generate a unique number.
  3. Take a note of the (i) Twilio phone number.
  4. Take a note of the (ii) account SID and (iii) auth token.
- All that remains now is to add a number that Twilio is able to call:
  1. Navigate to the [Verified Caller IDs page](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified).
  2. Press the red **+** to add a new personal number and follow the verification steps.
  3. One number is enough for now. You can repeat these steps to verify more than one number.

**In the end, you should have:**

1. A Twilio phone number.
2. The account SID is available in the account dashboard.
3. The auth token is available in the account dashboard.
4. A verified personal phone number *(at least one)*

If you wish to explore more advanced features, PANIC also supports configurable [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml); instructions that can re-program Twilio to do more than just call numbers. By default, the TwiML is set to [reject calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/reject) as soon as the recipient picks up, without any charges. This can be re-configured from the Twilio section of the `.env` file to either a URL or raw TwiML instructions.

### Replacing SSL certificates (recommended)

Apply your own SSL certificate signed by a certificate authority. The SSL certificate (cert.pem) and the key (key.pem) should be placed in the `panic/certificates` folder, and they should replace the existing dummy files. Note that these dummy files were given just for convenience as the Installer server won't start without them, however, for maximum security, these must be replaced.

We suggest reading [this](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/HTTP/servers/how-to-create-a-HTTPS-server/) for more details on SSL certificates, and how to generate a self-signed certificate in case you do not want to obtain a certificate signed by a certificate authority. However, for maximum security, the self-signed certificate option is not recommended.

### Running the PANIC test suite

To run the tests for the **alerter** component within PANIC, do the following:

```shell
# To stop any running containers (to avoid conflicts)
sudo docker-compose kill 

# To build the tests container
sudo docker-compose -p panic-tests -f docker-compose-tests.yml up --build -d

# To see the result of the tests
sudo docker-compose -p panic-tests -f docker-compose-tests.yml logs test-suite

# To remove test environment
sudo docker-compose -p panic-tests -f docker-compose-tests.yml kill
```

To run the tests for the **API** component within PANIC, navigate to the `/api` directory and do the following:

```shell
# Install API project dependencies + Run API unit tests
sudo npm install
sudo npm test
```

To run the tests for the **UI** component within PANIC, navigate to the `/ui` directory and do the following:

```shell
# Install UI project dependencies + Run UI E2E Unit Tests
sudo npm install
sudo npm test
```
