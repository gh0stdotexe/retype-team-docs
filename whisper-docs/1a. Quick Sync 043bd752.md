At times you will want to bootstrap a new node quickly or need to start from scratch on an existing node. To do this you can download a copy of the blockchain and get sync'd quicker.

To do this, first stop your node with:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop secret-node
```

Download the latest quicksync files for the network needed:

- Secret Network:  <https://quicksync.scrt.network>
- Juno:  [StakeCraft - Trustworthy Validator](https://snapshots.stakecraft.com/ "StakeCraft - Trustworthy Validator")

Then run each of these commands one at a time:

```shell
rm -rf ~/.junod/data
mkdir -p ~/.junod/data
cd ~/.junod/data
curl https://snapshots.stakecraft.com/juno-1_2021-12-03.tar -o  juno-1_2021-12-03.tar
```

Then change your node to prune everything so it works with the quicksync file.

Navigate to .secretd/config directory and edit the app.toml:

```shell
nano app.toml
```

Change the following value from "syncable" to "nothing":

```shell
# Pruning sets the pruning strategy: syncable, nothing, everything
# syncable: only those states not needed for state syncing will be deleted (keeps last 100 + every 10000th)
# nothing: all historic states will be saved, nothing will be deleted (i.e. archiving node)
# everything: all saved states will be deleted, storing only the current state
pruning = "everything"
```

Then start your node back up:

```shell
sudo systemctl start secret-node
```
