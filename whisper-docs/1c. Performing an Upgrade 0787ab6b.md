When performing a version upgrade to your validator, there are really only a few things that need to happen.

*Stop Cosmovisor*

```shell
sudo systemctl stop cosmovisor
```

*Install the software update*

```shell
cd ~/desmos
git checkout v2.3.0-mainnet
make install
```

*Verify that your upgrade was applied successfully.*

```shell
which desmos
```

*Once finished, we'll copy the updated files into Cosmovisor:*

```shell
cp /home/<your-user>/go/bin/desmos $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
```

*Add Environment variable to shell*

```shell
export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.desmos
export DAEMON_NAME=desmos
```

*Source the new variables to your .profile*

```shell
source ~/.profile
```

*Verify that your DAEMON\_NAME is correctly set*

```shell
echo $DAEMON_NAME
```

*Finally, we'll edit our cosmovisor file and disable node backups before upgrading.*&#x20;

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cosmovisor.service
```

*Add the following to your cosmovisor.service unit file, then reload:*

```shell
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
```

# Start Cosmovisor

Finally, enable the service and start it.

```shell
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
sudo -S systemctl enable cosmovisor
sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```

Check it is running using:

```shell
sudo systemctl status cosmovisor
```
