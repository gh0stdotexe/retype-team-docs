We have a few commands we can use to view disk usage and determine what is eating up all of our disk space.

View General Disk Usage

```shell
df -H
```

View Disk Usage - Human Depth (1)

This command will list the size of the files/folders in the current directory

<br>

```shell
#bytes, depth 1
du -hd1

#bytes, depth 2
du -hd2
```
