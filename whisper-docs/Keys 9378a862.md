Various commands to manage and use wallet keys in CLI:

## osmosisd keys add

Derive a new private key and encrypt to disk.

```shell
osmosisd keys add <key-name> [flags]
```

Flags:

| **Name, shorthand**  | **Description**                                                   |

| --no-backup          | Don't print out seed phrase (if others are watching the terminal) |
| --dry-run            | Perform action, but don't add key to local keystore               |
| --hd-path            | Manual HD Path derivation (overrides BIP44 config)                |
| --coin-type          | coin type number for HD derivation                                |
| --account            | Account number for HD derivation                                  |

| --algo               | Key signing algorithm to generate keys for                        |

## Create a new key

The following example will create a key in the local keystore named `MyKey`:

```
osmosisd keys add MyKey
```

Enter and repeat the password, at least 8 characters, then you will get a new key.

> **WARNING**
>
> write the seed phrase in a safe place! It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password, and/or something happens to your local keystore.

## Recover an existing key from seed phrase

If you forget your password or lose your key, or you would like to use your key in another place, you can recover your key by using the `--recover` flag.

The following example will recover a key with the seed phrase and store it in the local keystore with the name `MyKey`:

```shell
osmosisd keys add MyKey --recover
```

You'll be asked to enter and repeat the new password for your key, and enter the seed phrase. Then you get your key back.

```shell
Enter a passphrase for your key:
Repeat the passphrase:
Enter your recovery seed phrase:
```

## Create a multisig key

The following example creates a multisig key with 3 sub-keys, and specify the minimum number of signatures as 2. The transaction could be broadcast only when the number of signatures is greater than or equal to 2.

```
osmosisd keys add <multisig-keyname> --multisig-threshold=2 --multisig=<signer-keyname-1>,<signer-keyname-2>,<signer-keyname-3>
```

> **TIP**
>
> `<signer-keyname>` can be the type of "local/offline/ledger", but not "multi" type.
>
> If you don't have all the permission of sub-keys, you can ask for the `pubkey`'s to create the offline keys first, then you will be able to create the multisig key.
>
> Offline key can be created by `osmosisd keys add --pubkey`.

## Delete a local key

The following example will delete the key named `MyKey` from the local keystore:

```

```

## osmosisd keys export

Export the keystore of a key to stdout:

```
osmosisd keys export <key-name> [flags]
```

## Export keystore

The following example will export the key named `MyKey` to stdout:

```
osmosisd keys export Mykey
```

## osmosisd keys import

Import a ASCII armored private key into the local keybase.

```
osmosisd keys import <name> <keyfile> [flags]
```

**Import a ASCII armored private key**

The following example will import the private keys from `key-to-import.json` and store it in the local keystore with the name `MyKey`

```
osmosisd keys import MyKey key-to-import.json [flags]
```

## osmosisd keys list

List all the keys from the local keystore that have been stored by this key manager, along with their associated name, type, address and pubkey.

**Flags:**

| Name, shorthand | Description     |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| --list-name     | List names only |

## List all keys

The following example will list all keys in the local keystore managed by the osmosisd key manager:

```

## osmosisd keys mnemonic

Create a `bip39` mnemonic, sometimes called a seed phrase, by reading from the system entropy. To pass your own entropy, use `unsafe-entropy` mode.

```
osmosisd keys mnemonic [flags]
```

Flags:

| Name, shorthand  | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --unsafe-entropy | Prompt the user to supply their own entropy, instead of relying on the system |

## Create a bip39 mnemonic

The following example will create a new `bip39` seed phrase:

```
osmosisd keys mnemonic
```

You'll get a `bip39` mnemonic with 24 words, e.g.:

```
saddle lunch prefer aspect domain woman relief swarm exist behind cliff shadow meadow joke tower inherit upon tragic glow air march envelope joke estate
```

## osmosisd keys parse

| --address            | false   | Output the address only (overrides --output)        |

| --device             | false   | Output the address in a ledger device               |
| --multisig-threshold | 1       | K out of N required signatures                      |
| --pubkey             | false   | Output the public key only (overrides --output)     |

### Get details of a local key

The following example will return the details for the key named `MyKey` :&#x20;

```
osmosisd keys show MyKey
```

The following infos will be shown:

```shell
- name: MyKey
  type: local
  address: osmo1njgpy0g450wh02z8m7yce7r08fmflflkgv367j
  pubkey: osmopub1addwnpepqvcfcuf84pu08cpqthv8qe2qkyrwu8p9za0c9d8fp5pl4sllwhejx66rxyu
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []
```

## Get validator operator address

If an address has been bonded to be a validator operator (which the address you used to create a validator), then you can use `--bech val` to get the operator's address prefixed by `iva` and the pubkey prefixed by `ivp`:

```
osmosisd keys show MyKey --bech val
```

Example Output:

```
- name: Mykey
  type: local
  address: iva1tulwx2hwz4dv8te6cflhda64dn0984hakwgk4f
  pubkey: ivp1addwnpepq24rufap6u0sysqcpgsfzqhw3x8nfkhqhtmpgqt0369rlyqcg0vkgd8e6zy
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []
```
