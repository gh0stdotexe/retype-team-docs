This guide will help us install Tenderduty and connect it to the PagerDuty incident response system. This will enable us to monitor validator status and ensure that we're alerted if and only when there's a true uptime emergency with a node.

Server side installation is rather simple, with 2 major parts (Docker-Compose, and the Tenderduty app itself).

Let's begin!

# Install Compose

### Install Compose on Linux systems

On Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the [Compose repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases). Follow the instructions from the link, which involve running the `curl` command in your terminal to download the binaries. These step-by-step instructions are also included below.

> For `alpine`, the following dependency packages are needed: `py-pip`, `python3-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `openssl-dev`, `gcc`, `libc-dev`, `rust`, `cargo` and `make`.

1. *Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:*
   ```shell
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```
   > To install a different version of Compose, substitute `1.29.2` with the version of Compose you want to use.
   If you have problems installing with `curl`, see [Alternative Install Options](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#alternative-install-options) tab above.\

2. *Apply executable permissions to the binary:*
   ```shell
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

> **Note**: If the command `docker-compose` fails after installation, check your path. You can also create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin` or any other directory in your path.

For example:

```shell
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

1. *Optionally, install* [*command completion*](https://docs.docker.com/compose/completion/) *for the* *`bash`* *and* *`zsh`* *shell.*
2. *Test the installation.*

```shell
sudo docker-compose --version
```

# Install Docker Engine

### Install using the repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

### Set up the repository

1. Update the `apt` package index and install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS:
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
   ```
2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```
3. Use the following command to set up the **stable** repository. To add the **nightly** or **test** repository, add the word `nightly` or `test` (or both) after the word `stable` in the commands below. [Learn about **nightly** and **test** channels](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
   ```shell
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

## Install Docker Engine

- Update the `apt` package index, and install the *latest version* of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

- > **Got multiple Docker repositories?**
  >
  > If you have multiple Docker repositories enabled, installing or updating without specifying a version in the `apt-get install` or `apt-get update` command always installs the highest possible version, which may not be appropriate for your stability needs.

---

- **OPTIONAL**: To install a *specific version* of Docker Engine, list the available versions in the repo, then select and install:
  - a. List the versions available in your repo:
  ```shell
  apt-cache madison docker-ce

  docker-ce | 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
  docker-ce | 5:18.09.0~3-0~ubuntu-xenial | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
  docker-ce | 18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu       | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
  docker-ce | 18.06.0~ce~3-0~ubuntu       | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
  ```
  - Install a specific version using the version string from the second column, for example, `5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial`.
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
  ```

---

- Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the `hello-world` image.

```shell
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. The `docker` group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker commands. Continue to [Linux postinstall](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.

## Upgrade Docker Engine

To upgrade Docker Engine, first run:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
```

Then follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository), choosing the new version you want to install.

# TenderDuty

A [PagerDuty](https://github.com/PagerDuty/go-pagerduty) notifier for [Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) / [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) validators.

This will probably only work on Tendermint 0.34.x chains.

## Features

- Will send an alert if a certain threshold of (consecutive) missed pre-commits are seen.
- Alerts if the validator leaves the active set.
- Will resolve the alert once the validator is signing again.
- Accepts a list of Tendermint RPC endpoints and randomly connects to one (*does not need to run on the validator node.*)

## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/blockpane/tenderduty.git
cd tenderduty
go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o tenderduty main.go
```

## Options

```shell
Usage of tenderduty:
  -c string
        Required: consensus address (valcons) to monitor '<gaiad> tendermint show-address'
  -p string
        Required: pagerduty api key
  -reminder int
        send additional alert every <reminder> blocks if still missing (default 1200)
  -stalled int
        alert if minutes since last block exceeds this value (default 10)
  -test
        send a test alert to pager duty, wait 10 seconds, resolve the incident and exit
  -threshold int
        alert threshold for missed precommits (default 3)
  -u string
        Required: comma seperated list of tendermint RPC urls (http:// or unix://)
```

## Example use

```shell
$ tenderduty -c pagevalcons1... -u http://1.2.3.4:26657,http://3.4.5.6:26657 -p efghi...

```

### To find your consensus address (valcons)

```shell
gaiad tendermint show-address
```

### To find your pagerduty integration key

- Within PagerDuty, go to Services --> Service Directory --> New Service
- Give your service a name, select an escalation policy, and set an alert grouping preference
- Select the PagerDuty Events API V2 Integration, hit Create Service
- Copy the 32 character `Integration Key` on the tenderduty command line

## Run Tenderduty

After configuring Tenderduty, it's quite simple to run. Simply run:

```shell
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

You should then be all set! You can add the `-test` flag in your `docker-compose.yml` file to send test incident alerts if you wish.
