Just like the `top` command, the `htop` command also gives a detailed analysis of your CPU and memory usage. If you do not have installed `htop` on your system, you can install it by first updating your `apt` repositories through the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
```

And then installing `htop` by entering the following command as sudo:

```shell
sudo apt install htop
```

Once `htop` is installed, you can simply use the following command to print the required information:

```shell
htop
```

The ***`Mem`*** (Memory aka RAM) and ***`Swp`***Â (Swap) entries in the header indicate the used and total memory through which you can calculate the free memory available on your system.
