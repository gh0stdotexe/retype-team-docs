A Juno network validator may qualify for official delegations to be assigned by the core development reserve. New delegation rounds happen every 6 months and are assigned/ re-assigned based on the criteria listed below. A validator does not need to request delegations. Instead the core-1 team will screen the entire set 2 weeks prior to a new delegation round. Criteria are ranked either High, Medium or Low which indicates how each category is weighted. A validator may fulfill several of the criteria and therefore get a higher official delegation. Once a 6 month delegation round ends, the delegations are removed and reassigned based on the core criteria. The highest weight is allocated to dapp/contract development, core network development contributions & on-chain governance participation. The vision is for Juno validators to be active participants especially on the smart contract front as that is the core specialization of the Juno Hub.
