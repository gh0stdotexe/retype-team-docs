This guide aims to establish monitoring of nodes through the usage of Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter. (originally by @Dylanschultzie from the Secret Network docs site).

---

## Preparing our environment

- You will need to create new users for running Prometheus securely. This can be done by doing:

```shell
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus 
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false node_exporter
```

- Create the directories for storing the Prometheus binaries and its config files:

```shell
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
```

- Set the ownership of these directories to our `prometheus` user, to make sure that Prometheus can access to these folders:

```shell
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus 
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```

---

## Downloading and installing Node Exporter

As your Prometheus is only capable of collecting metrics, we want to extend its capabilities by adding **Node Exporter**, a tool that collects information about the system including [**CPU, disk, and memory usage**](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default) and exposes them for scraping.

- Download the latest version of Node Exporter:

```shell
sudo wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.2.2/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar xvf node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

- Copy the binary file into the directory `/usr/local/bin` and set the ownership to the user you have created in step previously:

```shell
sudo cp node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin 
sudo chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```

- Remove the leftover files of Node Exporter, as they are not needed any longer:

```shell
sudo rm -rf node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64
```

- To run Node Exporter automatically on each boot, a Systemd service file is required. Create the following file by opening it in Nano:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

- Copy the following information in the service file, save it and exit Nano:

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Node Exporter
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=node_exporter
Group=node_exporter
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Collectors are used to gather information about the system. By default a set of collectors is activated. You can see the details about the set in the [**README-file**](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/blob/master/README.md#enabled-by-default). If you want to use a specific set of collectors, you can define them in the `ExecStart` section of the service. Collectors are enabled by providing a `--collector.<name>` flag. Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.<name>` flag.

- Reload Systemd to use the newly defined service, start & enable automatic restarts of node exporter:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl start node_exporter 
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
```

You will see an output like this, showing you the status `active (running)` as well as the main PID of the application:

```shell
● node_exporter.service - Node Exporter
Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Mon 2018-06-25 11:47:06 UTC; 4s ago
Main PID: 1719 (node_exporter)
CGroup: /system.slice/node_exporter.service
└─1719 /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```

- If everything is working, enable Node Exporter to be started on each boot of the server:

```shell
journalctl -u node_exporter -f
```

---

## Download and install Prometheus

- Download and Unpack [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/download/) latest release of Prometheus:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.31.1/prometheus-2.31.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar xfz prometheus-2.31.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-2.31.1.linux-amd64
```

The following two binaries are in the directory:

- Prometheus - Prometheus main binary file
- promtool

The following two folders (which contain the web interface, configuration files examples and the license) are in the directory:

- consoles
- console\_libraries
  <br>
- Copy the binary files into the `/usr/local/bin/`directory:

```shell
sudo cp ./prometheus /usr/local/bin/ 
sudo cp ./promtool /usr/local/bin/
```

- Set the ownership of these files to the `prometheus` user previously created:

```shell
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus 
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
```

- Copy the `consoles` and `console_libraries` directories to `/etc/prometheus`:

```shell
sudo cp -r ./consoles /etc/prometheus 
sudo cp -r ./console_libraries /etc/prometheus
```

- Set the ownership of the two folders, as well as of all files that they contain, to our `prometheus` user:

```shell
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles 
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries
```

- In our home folder, remove the source files that are not needed anymore :

```shell
cd .. && sudo rm -rf prometheus-2.31.1.linux-amd64 prometheus-2.31.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

---

## Configuring Prometheus

Prior to using Prometheus, it needs basic configuring. Thus, we need to create a configuration file named `prometheus.yml`

**Note:** The configuration file of Prometheus is written in [**YAML**](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) which strictly forbids to use tabs. If your file is incorrectly formatted, Prometheus will not start. Be careful when you edit it.

- Open the file `prometheus.yml` in a text editor:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Prometheus’ configuration file is divided into three parts: `global`, `rule_files`, and `scrape_configs`.

In the `global` part we can find the general configuration of Prometheus: `scrape_interval` defines how often Prometheus scrapes targets, `evaluation_interval` controls how often the software will evaluate rules. Rules are used to create new time series and for the generation of alerts.

The `rule_files` block contains information of the location of any rules we want the Prometheus server to load.

The last block of the configuration file is named `scape_configs` and contains the information which resources Prometheus monitors.

Our file should look like this example:

```yaml
global:  
  scrape_interval:     15s  
  evaluation_interval: 15s
  
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"  
  # - "second.rules"
  
scrape_configs:  
  - job_name: 'prometheus'    
    scrape_interval: 5s    
	static_configs:      
	  - targets: ['localhost:9093']
```

The global `scrape_interval` is set to 15 seconds which is enough for most use cases.

We do not have any `rule_files` yet, so the lines are commented out and start with a `#`.

In the `scrape_configs` part we have defined our first exporter. It is Prometheus that monitors itself. As we want to have more precise information about the state of our Prometheus server we reduced the `scrape_interval` to 5 seconds for this job. The parameters `static_configs`and `targets` determine where the exporters are running. In our case it is the same server, so we use `localhost` and the port `9090`.

As Prometheus scrapes only exporters that are defined in the `scrape_configs` part of the configuration file, we have to add Node Exporter to the file, as we did for Prometheus itself.

We add the following part below the configuration for scraping Prometheus:

```yaml
- job_name: 'node_exporter'  
  scrape_interval: 5s  
  static_configs:    
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

Overwrite the global scrape interval again and set it to 5 seconds. As we are scarping the data from the same server as Prometheus is running on, we can use `localhost` with the default port of Node Exporter: `9100`.

If you want to scrape data from a remote host, you have to replace `localhost` with the IP address of the remote server.

**Tip:** For all information about the configuration of Prometheus, you may check the [**configuration documentation**](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).

- Set the ownership of the file to our `Prometheus` user:

```shell
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Our Prometheus server is ready to run for the first time.

---

## Running Prometheus

- Start Prometheus directly from the command line with the following command, which executes the binary file as our `Prometheus` user:

```shell
sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries --web.listen-address=:9093 --web.enable-lifecycle
```

The server starts displaying multiple status messages and the information that the server has started:

```shell
level=info ts=2018-04-12T11:56:53.084000977Z caller=main.go:220 msg="Starting Prometheus" version="(version=2.2.1, branch=HEAD, revision=bc6058c81272a8d938c05e75607371284236aadc)"

level=info ts=2018-04-12T11:56:53.104047346Z caller=main.go:491 msg="Server is ready to receive web requests."
```

- Open your browser and type [`http://IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER:9090`](http://IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER:9090) to access the Prometheus interface. If everything is working, we end the task by pressing on `CTRL + C` on our keyboard.
  <br>
  **Note:** If you get an error message when you start the server, double check your configuration file for possible YAML syntax errors. The error message will tell you what to check.

  If the error received is a "port already bound/in use" error, another instance may be running. Use the following command to kill any existing Prometheus instances:

```shell
sudo pkill -e prometheus
```

- The server is working now, but it cannot yet be launched automatically at boot. To achieve this, we have to create a new `systemd` configuration file that will tell your OS which services should it launch automatically during the boot process.

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```

The service file tells `systemd` to run Prometheus as `prometheus` and specifies the path of the configuration files.

- Copy the following information in the file and save it, then exit the editor:

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Monitoring
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
--config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
--web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
--web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries \
--web.listen-address=:9093
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- To use the new service, reload `systemd`, enable prometheus, and start it:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable prometheus 
sudo systemctl start prometheus
journalctl -u prometheus -f
```

Your Prometheus server is ready to be used. Let's check the status of Prometheus just to be We have now installed Prometheus to monitor your instance. Prometheus provides a basic web server running on [`http://your.server.ip:9000`](http://your.server.ip:9000) that provide access to the data collected by the software.

---

## Installing Grafana

- Install Grafana on our instance which queries our Prometheus server.

```shell
wget https://dl.grafana.com/enterprise/release/grafana-enterprise_8.3.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig
sudo dpkg -i grafana-enterprise_8.3.0_amd64.deb
```

- Enable the automatic start of Grafana by `systemd`:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable grafana-server && sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```

Grafana is running now, and we can connect to it at [`http://your.server.ip:3000`](http://your.server.ip:3000). The default user and password is `admin` / `admin`.

Now you have to create a Prometheus data source: - Click the Grafana logo to open the sidebar. - Click “Data Sources” in the sidebar. - Choose “Add New”. - Select “Prometheus” as the data source. - Set the Prometheus server URL (in our case: <http://localhost:9090/)> - Click “Add” to test the connection and to save the new data source.

## Installing Cosmos SDK Grafana Dashboard

Finally, we're going to install a basic dashboard for Cosmos SDKs. For further reference in these steps, see: <https://github.com/zhangyelong/cosmos-dashboard>

- Enable Tendermint metrics

```shell
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' <YOUR-NODE-HOMEDIR>/config/config.toml
```

After restarting your node, you should be able to access the tendermint metrics(default port is 26660): [**http://localhost:26660**](http://localhost:26660)

- Configure Prometheus Targets

Append a `job` under the `scrape_configs` of your prometheus.yml

```yaml
  - job_name: secret-network
	static_configs:
	- targets: ['<Validator-IP>:26660']
	  labels:
		instance: validator
	- targets: ['<Sentry-0-IP>:26660']
	  labels:
		instance: sentry-0
	- targets: ['<Sentry-1-IP>:26660']
	  labels:
		instance: sentry-1
```

- Reload prometheus config

```shell
curl -X POST http://<PROMETHEUS-IP>:9090/-/reload
```

- Import Grafana Dashboard

Copy and paste the [**Grafana Dashboard ID**](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11036) `11036` OR content of [**cosmos-dashboard.json**](https://github.com/zhangyelong/cosmos-dashboard/blob/master/cosmos-dashboard.json), click on `Load` to complete importing.

- Set chain-id to `<chain-id>`
- You're done!
